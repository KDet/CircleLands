# CircleLands
Unity: Game created using only UI-items.

The player moves around the circle land and should avoid obstacles. He gets a ﬂag  for each passed round. Flags - the 
currency for which you can buy new avatars and lands. There is an opportunity to return to the game after a loss or gain 
additional ﬂags by watching аn advertisement.

####Code sample

To achieve MVVM pattern in the game were used Unity events. For example:

Code snippet

    ```
    [Serializable] public class DistanceChanged : UnityEvent<int> { }
    [SerializeField] private DistanceChanged _onDistanceChanged = new DistanceChanged();
    public int Distanse
    {
    	get { return _distanse; }
    	set
    	{
    		_distanse = value;
    		OnValueChanged(ref _distanse, _onDistanceChanged);
    	}
    }
    ```
